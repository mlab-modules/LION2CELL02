## Power Delivery

The module supports BC 1.2 for charging. For the full USB Power Delivery (PD) support, an external USB PD controller is required. The MLAB [USBPDSINK01](https://www.mlab.cz/module/USBPDSINK01/) module can be used to enable PD functionality.

## Usage Instructions

1. Equip the LION2CELL02 module with pair of the suitable 16850 Li-Ion batteries.
2. Connect a USB-C power source to the module. For standard charging, ensure the power source complies with BC 1.2.
3. For USB PD, connect the USBPDSINK01 module to enable PD negotiation and charging.
4. Monitor the LED indicators for battery and charging status.
5. Connect to an MCU and use I2C/smbus for advanced features. 

## Safety and Protection

- The module includes multiple layers of protection for voltage, current, and temperature to ensure safe operation.
- Integrated cell balancing ensures equal charging across all cells, preventing overcharge and extending battery life.

## Applications

- UPS/battery backup systems
- Stand-alone measurement devices
- Scientific equipment
