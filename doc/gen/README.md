Solder paste stats:

Using a paste with 87.75 % alloy, that has an specific gravity for the alloy of 7.4 g/cm³
and 1.0 g/cm³ for the flux. This paste has an specific gravity of  4.15 g/cm³.

The stencil thickness is  0.12 mm.

| Side   | Pads with paste | Area [mm²] | Paste [g] |
|--------|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| Top    |              14 |      17.38 |      0.09 |
| Bottom |             223 |     266.57 |      1.33 |
| Total  |             237 |     283.95 |      1.41 |

Note: this is just an approximation to the theoretical value. Margins of the solder mask and waste aren't computed.
